# SuperTuxBattleMelee

SuperTuxBattleMelee is a platform fighter featuring Tux and his friends (or arch nemesis). Fight in several arenas, eject your opponents, and be the mascot king/queen.

## Project advancement

Right now it's in a very early stage of development. Here are the things I have in mind and that needs to be done:
- [ ] Rendering engine (with OpenGL 2.1 and 3.3)
- [ ] Keyboard/Controller support
- [ ] Characters design
  - [ ] Tux
  - [ ] Gnu
  - [ ] Nolok
  - [ ] Konqi/Katie
  - [ ] Xue
  - [ ] Hexley
  - [ ] Wilber
  - [ ] Kiki
  - [ ] Suzanne
  - [ ] Sophia (aka Godette)
  - [ ] Pepper and Carrot
  - [ ] ...and more
- [ ] Stage design (one for each character)
- [ ] Physics engine (will likely use Chipmunk)
- [ ] Sounds and music (either SDL_mixer or OpenAL)
- [ ] Networking (either SDL_net or enet)

Feel free to tell me if you're thinking of something else to implement.
